# turnLeftSimulator
Watch this intense, high-octane, battle between racers as they attempt to turn left faster than the others. (This is just a race visualization)

My longest project in terms of code as of December 2019. Hopefully I am improving in the right areas, but this was still a fun experience.

See you on the finish line - kachow
